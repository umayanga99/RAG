Design Guide
A design model for
VMware Cloud Foundation
(also called VCF) that is based on industry best practices for SDDC implementation.
The
VMware Cloud Foundation
Design Guide
provides the supported design options for
VMware Cloud Foundation
, and a set of decision points, justifications, implications, and considerations for building each component.
Intended Audience
This
VMware Cloud Foundation
Design Guide
is intended for cloud architects who are familiar with and want to use
VMware Cloud Foundation
to deploy and manage an SDDC that meets the requirements for capacity, scalability, backup and restore, and extensibility for disaster recovery support.
Before You Apply This Guidance
The sequence of the
VMware Cloud Foundation
documentation follows the stages for implementing and maintaining an SDDC.
To apply this
VMware Cloud Foundation
Design Guide
, you must be acquainted with the
Getting Started with
VMware Cloud Foundation
documentation and with the
VMware Cloud Foundation Release Notes
. See
VMware Cloud Foundation documentation
.
For performance best practices for vSphere, see
Performance Best Practices for VMware vSphere 8.0 Update 1
.
Design Elements
This
VMware Cloud Foundation
Design Guide
contains requirements and recommendations for the design of each component of the SDDC. In situations where a configuration choice exists, requirements and recommendations are available for each choice. Implement only those of them that are relevant to your target configuration.
Design Element
Description
Requirement
Required for the operation of
VMware Cloud Foundation
. Deviations are not permitted.
Recommendation
Recommended as a best practice. Deviations are permitted.
VMware Cloud Foundation
Deployment Options in This Design
This design guidance is for the all architecture models of
VMware Cloud Foundation
. By following the guidance, you can examine the design for these deployment options:
Single
VMware Cloud Foundation
instance.
Single
VMware Cloud Foundation
instance with multiple availability zones (also known as stretched deployment). The default vSphere cluster of the workload domain is stretched between two availability zones by using
vSAN
and configuring
vSphere DRS rules
and
BGP routing
accordingly.
Multiple
VMware Cloud Foundation
instances. You deploy several instances of
VMware Cloud Foundation
to address requirements for scale and co-location of users and resources.
For disaster recovery, workload mobility, or propagation of common configuration to multiple
VMware Cloud Foundation
instances, you can deploy
NSX Federation
for the SDDC management and workload components.
Multiple
VMware Cloud Foundation
instances with multiple availability zones. You apply the configuration for stretched clusters for a single
VMware Cloud Foundation
instance to one or more additional
VMware Cloud Foundation
instances in your environment.
vCenter Single Sign-On Options in This Design
This design guidance covers the topology with a single vCenter Single Sign-On domain in a
VMware Cloud Foundation
instance and the topology with several isolated vCenter Single Sign-On domains in a single instance. See
vCenter Single Sign-On Design Requirements for VMware Cloud Foundation
.
VMware Cloud Foundation
Design Blueprints
You can follow design blueprints for selected architecture models and topologies that list the applicable design elements. See
VMware Cloud Foundation Design Blueprints
.
