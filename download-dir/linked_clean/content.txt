Response Times: Rough Guide
Definition
The following times provide you with an overview of the optimal response times in your SAP system. You can display the current
workload overview
for your system with the workload monitor.
Proportions of the Response Time
Performance Data
Time
Average response time
Around 1 second (dialog), < 1 second (update)
Average CPU time
Around 40% of the average response time
Average wait time
< 1% of the average response time
Average load time
< 10% of the average response time
Average database time per dialog step
Around 40% of the average response time
Note
The operating system can affect these values by up to around 10%.
The ratio of the CPU time to the total time should not fall under 5%. A smaller proportion could mean that there is an input/output bottleneck or that a database overload has caused long wait times.
The average response times for dialog transactions (online transactions) should not be more than a second, since a higher value would strain the patience of the user too much.
Times for Database Access
Database Access
Time
Direct read
< 10 ms
Sequential read
< 40 ms
Changes
> 25 ms
Possible Causes of Bad Response Times
High Value For
Possible Causes
DB request (Change/Comm.)
Problems with database or index
Load time
Buffer too small
Transports to the productive system
Wait time
Insufficient work processes
Inactive update
Incorrect operation mode
Locked tasks
Long-running transactions
Note
In a database system that is functioning properly, the times for direct reads and changes should not be more than 10 milliseconds.
The time for sequential reads should not be more than 30-40 milliseconds.
