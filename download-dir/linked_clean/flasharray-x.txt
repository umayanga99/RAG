What is NVM Express (NVMe) storage?
NVMe (non-volatile memory express) is a transfer protocol for accessing data quickly from flash memory storage devices, such as solid-state drives (SSDs) over a computer's high-speed Peripheral Component Interconnect Express (PCIe) bus. Pure Storage FlashArray//X leverages the increased transfer speeds of NVMe over PCIe to provide a performant all-flash storage array.

People also ask:
1.
What is NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF)?
NVMe over Fabrics (NVMe-oF) is an extension of the NVMe network protocol to Ethernet and Fibre Channel, delivering faster and more efficient connectivity between storage and servers.

2.
What are the benefits of NVMe-oF?
NVMe-oF delivers faster connectivity between storage and applications on servers, as well as more efficient CPU usage. This enables further consolidation in the data center of apps that traditionally rely on direct-attached storage (DAS).

3.
NVMe-oF vs. iSCSI
NVMe-oF and iSCSI are both network protocols used to facilitate communication between hosts and storage systems over a network. While iSCSI evolved to serve spinning-disk drives, NVMe-oF is a new protocol designed specifically to unlock the high-performance, low-latency, massively parallel data-access capabilities of native NVMe storage for your data center.
