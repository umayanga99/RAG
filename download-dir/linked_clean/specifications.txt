This feature may not be available on all computing systems. Please check with the system vendor to determine if your system delivers this feature, or reference the system specifications (motherboard, processor, chipset, power supply, HDD, graphics controller, memory, BIOS, drivers, virtual machine monitor-VMM, platform software, and/or operating system) for feature compatibility. Functionality, performance, and other benefits of this feature may vary depending on system configuration.
Intel processor numbers are not a measure of performance. Processor numbers differentiate features within each processor family, not across different processor families. See

for details.
Recommended Customer Price (RCP) is pricing guidance only for Intel products. Prices are for direct Intel customers, usually represent 1,000-unit purchase quantities, and are subject to change without notice. Prices may vary for other package types and shipment quantities. In bulk, price represents individual unit. Listing of RCP does not constitute a formal pricing offer from Intel.
System and Maximum TDP is based on worst case scenarios.  Actual TDP may be lower if not all I/Os for chipsets are used.
“Announced” SKUs are not yet available. Please refer to the Launch Date for market availability.
Max Turbo Frequency refers to the maximum single-core processor frequency that can be achieved with Intel® Turbo Boost Technology. See
https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/gaming/resources/turbo-boost.html
for more information and applicability of this technology.
See
http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html?wapkw=hyper+threading
for more information including details on which processors support Intel® HT Technology.
Processors that support 64-bit computing on Intel® architecture require an Intel 64 architecture-enabled BIOS.
Some products can support AES New Instructions with a Processor Configuration update, in particular, i7-2630QM/i7-2635QM, i7-2670QM/i7-2675QM, i5-2430M/i5-2435M, i5-2410M/i5-2415M.  Please contact OEM for the BIOS that includes the latest Processor configuration update.
