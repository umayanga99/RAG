# ── Image-caption prompt template (skip logos / decorative art) ──────────────
IMAGE_DESCRIPTION_PROMPT = """
You are a domain expert reviewing a single image extracted from a technical PDF.

TASK  
Return a concise yet complete description of the *technical meaning* conveyed in
the image (systems, components, data-flows, parameters, etc.).

SKIP / IGNORE  
• Purely decorative elements (company logos, product logos, watermarks)  
• Colour stripes, page banners, separator bars, or background patterns  
• Images that contain no technical information

IF the image is decorative-only, output exactly:  
    "Irrelevant (decorative image – no useful technical content)."

INCLUDE when relevant  
• Named components, services, layers, or modules  
• Arrows / lines that show dependencies, data-flows, or control flow  
• Configuration values, limits, key parameter names shown in text  
• Decision points or conditional steps (e.g., “If X, then Y”)  
• Warnings, footnotes, or legends that affect implementation

FORMAT  
Provide the result as an unordered bullet list (Markdown “• ” bullets).  
Keep each bullet short and fact-focused (one fact per bullet).
